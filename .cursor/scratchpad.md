# TicTacToe Farcaster Share Implementation

## Background and Motivation
We need to implement a complete Farcaster sharing functionality for the TicTacToe game, based on the minicolours implementation. The goal is to allow users to share their game results on Farcaster with a beautiful preview card and proper metadata.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Current Implementation Status:
   - ✅ Basic `farcaster-share.ts` with core functionality
   - ✅ Share page implementation
   - ✅ GameResultCard component for display
   - ✅ GameResultEmbed component for preview
   - ❌ Missing proper integration in game flow
   - ❌ Missing metadata for share preview
   - ❌ Missing proper share button placement

2. Key Differences from Minicolours:
   - Different game data structure (TicTacToe vs Color game)
   - Different visual style requirements
   - Need to adapt share text format
   - Need to integrate with game flow

## High-level Task Breakdown

3. Integrate Share Button in Game Flow
