# TicTacToe Game Result Recording with Sub Accounts

## Background and Motivation
Using Sub Accounts to handle game result recording on-chain without disrupting the user experience with constant transaction signing.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### 1. Current Pain Points
- Each game result requires a separate transaction
- Users must sign every transaction
- Multiple gas fees for frequent players
- Poor UX with constant signing prompts
- High friction for recording results

### 2. Sub Account Solution
- Create game-specific Sub Account per player
- Batch multiple results into single transaction
- Handle gas fees through Sub Account
- Pre-approve spending limits
- Transparent transaction handling

### 3. Implementation Strategy
1. Sub Account Setup:
   ```typescript
   interface GameSubAccount {
     address: string;
     spendLimit: BigNumber;
     resultQueue: GameResult[];
     batchThreshold: number;
   }

   interface GameResult {
     result: 'win' | 'loss' | 'draw';
     opponent: string;
     timestamp: number;
     roomCode: string;
   }
   ```

2. Result Batching:
   ```typescript
   class ResultBatcher {
     // Queue up results until threshold
     async queueResult(result: GameResult) {
       queue.push(result);
       if (queue.length >= batchThreshold) {
         await this.processBatch();
       }
     }

     // Process batch through Sub Account
     async processBatch() {
       const batch = queue.splice(0, batchThreshold);
       await subAccount.recordResults(batch);
     }
   }
   ```

## High-level Task Breakdown

1. Sub Account Integration
   - Success Criteria:
     - Sub Account creation on first game
     - Proper permissions setup
     - Gas handling configured
     - Result batching working

2. Result Recording Flow
   - Success Criteria:
     - Queue system working
     - Batch processing implemented
     - Gas optimization working
     - Clear transaction feedback

3. User Experience
   - Success Criteria:
     - No signing prompts for each result
     - Clear status updates
     - Batch progress visible
     - Gas savings shown
